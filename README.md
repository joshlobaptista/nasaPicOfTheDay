# nasaPicOfTheDay

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and and API. 

In this project I was learing how to use APIs and the first API I used was the NASA API. I had to pull from the API a picture of the day, so when I look up a past date It shows a picture that NASA took from that day

Lessons Learned:
I learn how to access and pull from an API !
